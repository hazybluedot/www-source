### Instructor: Darren Maczka

## As you come in...

before you take a seat, please come and introduce yourself to me and
if necessary help me pronounce your name.

## Once seated...

turn to your neighbor. Introduce yourself, and ask what their major is
(yes, there are some non-CpEs!) and why they chose it. Also ask about
any prior experience with Unix/Linux they have had.
