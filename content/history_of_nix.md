After the multic project Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson continued to
persure the idea of OS design to support their game Space Travel.
Requests to AT&T for funding to purchase a new computer were denied,
they used an old (even by the day's standards) PDP-7.  The requests
were for too much money for too few people, for a project with rather
vague goals and one that AT&T was wary of pursuing after just backing
out of a big OS project.

Early 1970 they made another proposal, this time to purchase a new
PDP-11 and instead of seeking the system for the relatively vague
notion of OS design, if obtained, they would use it to develop a
system to facilitate text processing and formatting (what we might
today refer to as a "word processor").  The success of PDP-7 Unix lead
to porting the system to PDP-11 to use as a development tool for the
more special purpose text processing system.

The B programming language was used to write certain pieces of the new
PDP-11 system. Technical limitations of B lead to development of the C
language.
