As a group, create a text file named `README` or `README.md` containing the following information

~~~~ text
Project Title

contributors: astudent, rflowers, spilgrim
url: https://github.com/rflowers/super_cool_project

Summary of project, just a few sentences. This will be displayed on
the project index page. If you format your file with [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
then name it `README.md`

<!-- more -->

Description of the project. Be sure to explain how you plan to use
elements of Unix design philosophy to implement the project.
~~~~

You may leave the url empty if you haven't set up a
[github](https://github.com/) page yet.  The contributors should be a
comma separated list of user names.

Each member of the group should add a copy of the `README` file to
their own repo `USER/project` and push to the server.
