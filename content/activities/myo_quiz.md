This assignment is optional. If you complete it, your score will be
counted as an extra quiz grade.

## Find Relevant Reading Material

1. Read a chapter of either TAOUP or The Linux Command Line that we did
  *not* cover in class this semester.

  OR

  Find and read a relevant online resource of similar scope to a
  single chapter of the aformentioned resources that we did not cover
  in class this semester.

## Design Reading Assignment and Quiz
1. Design a reading assignment based on the reading of your choice
2. Write 2-3 "Self Study" questions. These should be designed to
   encourage creative thinking and making connections between the
   reading and programming, or other concepts.
3. Design several questions related to the reading that could be used
   to evaluate the understanding of the material.

   - avoid questions that simply require good memorization to answer
     correctly
   - provide at least a couple multiple choice questions and at least
     one free-response question.
   - design at least 3 questions and up to 6 questions.
   - indicate the correct multiple choice response
   - include at least one sample response for each free-response question
   
## Collectables

Write up your reading assignment in a [markdown] formatted file named
`README.md` in a new git repository.

## Grading

Assuming the reading is of an appropriate content and scope and the
self-study questions are thought provoking the quiz questions will be
graded for quality:

  - multiple choice questions: 1 point
  - free-response: 2 points
