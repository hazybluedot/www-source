## Background

Read [Chapters 1-3](/assets/TLCL-13.07.pdf#page=26) of [TLCL](/assets/TLCL-13.07.pdf).  Practice the commands at least once, but
don't worry about memorizing them, you will naturally memorize the as
you use them more often.

## Self Study
1. Practice being aware of what your current working directory is.
1. The behavior of some commands depends on the current working
   directory when they are executed, while other commands don't depend
   on the value of the *cwd*.  Categorize the commands you have
   learned so far based on this distinction.  What properties of a
   command might you be able to deduce based on what category it is
   in?
1. Recognize the difference between relative and absolute paths
