1. Be familiar with all background reading up until this point.

2. Read the [Preface](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/preface.html) and chapter
   [I.1 Philosophy](http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/philosophychapter.html)
   of
   [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/). Pick
   two nuggets that jump out at you and blog about them.  These could
   either be things that spark your interest, or that you don't quite
   understand. Be sure to include a cited quote for each nugget. How
   do you hope to explore these interests in this class?

3. Submit your feed url:
   - If you are not already, get in the `#ece2524` IRC channel.
   - Send a private message to `RoboRitchie` to tell him your PID

     ~~~~~ irc
     /msg RoboRitchie my pid is <pid>
     ~~~~~
     {: .command-syntax }
     
     Where `<pid>` is your Virginia Tech PID.

   - Switch to the buffer containing the private chat with `RoboRitchie` to check for any errors.
   - Tell `RoboRitchie` to add your feed url

     ~~~~
     /msg RoboRitchie add feed <feed_url>
     ~~~~
     {: .command-syntax }

     Where `<feed_url>` is a working URL to a page on your blog, or an RSS/Atom feed.

   You will only have to do this once. After this any new posts you
   write will be pulled from the existing feed.
