title: Review Past Projects
kind: reading
---

Take a look at a couple
[projects from the Fall 2013 semester](/projects/#fall-2013).  Some of
the descriptions are not appearing properly on the list, so click
through to the Homepage and view the README.  Try at least one out by
cloning the 'HTTPS clone URL' displayed in the left sidebar of the
gitub page.

Remember, you could add some features or fix bugs on a past project as
your own project for this semester.
