## Where we left off

Both `user1` and `user2` should be able to read/pull from the other's repository

- `user1` has read access to `user2/forks/wordfreq`
- `user2` has read access to `user1/wordfreq`

- `user1` has a remote named `origin` with repo name `user1/wordfreq`
- `user1` has a remote named `user2` with repo name `user2/forks/wordfreq`

- `user2` has a remote named `origin` with repo name `user2/forks/wordfreq`
- `user2` has a remote named `upstream` with repo name `user1/wordfreq`
