Go over the
[notes from last class](/activities/inclass_week13_1/). Note, to run
the code for the record-jar parser you will need to download the
source file that is linked and save it to your current working
directory.

## Self Study

1. Write a `yaml2json` program in Python that reads an input file in
   `yaml` format and writes out a file in `json` format.
2. Write a `rjar2yaml` program in Python that reads input in
   `record-jar` format and converts the information to `yaml` format
   on *standard output*.
3. The `yaml` file produced by `rjar2yaml` will probably not be
   identical to the `yaml` file we wrote by hand to describe the same
   data.  Both are valid `yaml` files, why are they different?
