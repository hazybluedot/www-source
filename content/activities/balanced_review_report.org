#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
modularity: [0-3]
orthogonality: [0-3]
spot: [0-3]
strong_center: [0-3]

a short paragraph with your feedback and suggestions to AUTHOR to make their code easier to read, more modular, etc.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where you rate each property on a scale of 0 to 3: 0 corresponding to
no demonstration of this property in AUTHOR's code, and 3 indicating
AUTHORs code demonstrates the property perfectly.

add/commit the ~report.txt~ file and push the repo.  Remember, the remote 'origin' should be ~<%= config[:git_url]%>:REVIEWER/forks/AUTHOR/balanced.git~
