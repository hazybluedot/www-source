** Terminology
~REVIEWER~ : the person or username reviewing the code
~AUTHOR~ : the username of the original author, or the author of the code being reviewed.
During the course of today everyone will work both in the context of being the ~AUTHOR~ and the ~REVIEWER~
** Prepare your code for sharing
- Make sure all your changes are added and committed to the ~master~
  branch of your repo.
- push your changes to the server
** No Network?
   If you are unable to connect to the network then clone your repo to
   a USB flash drive or other removable media.

   #+END_SRC

** As a REVIEWER
   Fork a copy of the AUTHOR's code to your own repository, and then clone a local copy
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC console
   $ ssh <%= config[:git_url]%> fork AUTHOR/balanced REVIEWER/forks/AUTHOR/balanced
   $ git clone <%= config[:git_url]%>:AUTHOR/balanced.git ~/ece2524/review/AUTHOR/balanced
   $ cd ~/ece2524/review/AUTHOR/balanced
