title: Reflection and Looking Forward
kind: activity

1. Reflect upon the past readings, activities and discussions.

2. Blog about any connections you can make between the topics we have
   discussed to material in other classes, or elsewhere. Also mention
   material that we have discussed that has *not* connected to
   anything else.

   - Has there been anything in particular that we have done or talked
   about that has seemed particularly relevent or particularly
   irrelevant to your own interests as computer engineers?

   - Are there any topics in particular that you would like us to
   cover in the remaining weeks? Should we spend more or less time on
   anything we have covered so far?
