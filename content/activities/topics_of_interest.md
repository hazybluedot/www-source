kind: activity

We have a lot of potential topics to cover and not enough time, please
fill out
[this survey](https://survey.vt.edu/survey/entry.jsp?id=1396993347074)
by the end of the week (Friday, 11:59pm) to indicate what you are most
interested in covering in the remaining weeks.

I have suggested several topics we could cover (the names and
descriptions are also copied on
[the survey](https://survey.vt.edu/survey/entry.jsp?id=1396993347074)
for your convenience).

## Potential Topics

### Advanced build tools/library packaging

Writing and packaging code to be used as shared libraries, like the analytics library we have been using.

### Debugging

Tracking down the line number at which Segmentation Faults are occurring, detecting loop errors, setting conditional breakpoints and inspecting contents of memory at runtime. We could also talk about checking for memory leaks.

### More interface patterns

Examples and a project involving either the 'ed' pattern or a "separate engine/interface" pattern like client/server

### Parsing Tools

Parsing config files and using flex and bison to generate more advanced string parsers (will also cover regular expressions) (i.e. to write programs like a shell, or text-based adventure game)

###Introduction to Python

Using the Python language to write programs following the filter interface pattern and handle command line options. Common Python idioms and the differences in programming style compared to C/C++
