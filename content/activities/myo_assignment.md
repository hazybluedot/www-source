This assignment is optional. If you complete it, your score will be
counted as an extra homework grade.

## Design a programming assignment

Write an assignment that would be suitable for next semester's ECE2524
class. The scope should be similar to one of the 30 point assignments
posted for this semester. The assignment you write could be
written/creative, or technical/programming, or a combination. The
assignment should be relevent to an "Introduction to Unix" course, but
need not be restricted to the topics that we covered this
semester. You do not need to supply a solution, but are of course
welcome to do so if you choose.

## Justification

In a separate `README` file answer the following questions regarding
the assignment you proposed.

  1. Why is this assignment relevent to an Intro to Unix course?
  2. how does the assignment exercise or encourage Unix design philosophy?
  2. How should points be distributed for this assignment, i.e. what
     percentage should go to syntax, style, functionality, content,
     etc. If the solution fails to work at all (fails to compile, or
     fails to run) how should it be evaluated?

## Test Specification (optional)

In a separate directory named `features` create one or more
cucumber/aruba feature files that specify tests for all aspects of the
finished program.

## Collectables

- The assignment write-up should be in a file named `README.md` and
  must be formated using [markdown] syntax.
- commit your files and push to
