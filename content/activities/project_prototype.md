Your project code should be published to a publicly accessible
repository such as [github] or [bitbucket].  The code that is
submitted *must* work. If you need to, don't include features that
aren't working yet, but make a note of them in your `README` file.

[github]: https://github.com/
[bitbucket]: https://bitbucket.org/
