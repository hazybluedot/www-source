1. Familiarize yourself with all background material and programming
   exercises we have done until this point.

2. Read a couple of the posts written by others in the class. Comment
   on at least one. Your comment should be thoughtful and
   constructive, adding something to the original author's post, even
   if it's just a question you have after reading it.

2. Write a blog post about your experiences with the work from this
   class, another class, or extracurricular activity.  It really is
   open ended, nothing is out of bounds, but do try to connect what
   you write in some way to the Unix design philosophy (some of you
   have noted already that several of the design rules are very
   applicable for non-software design).

   You may find that a comment on someone else's post is turning into
   a post of it's own.  That's fine, you may write comments as your
   own blog post, but be sure to link to the original author's post
   and leave a comment on the original author's blog providing a link
   to your response post.
