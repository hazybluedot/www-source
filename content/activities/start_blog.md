## Use an existing blog

If you already have one, you may certainly use an existing blog for
this class.  I will filter the feeds to only syndicate posts made on
or after the first day of class of the current semester.

If you are actively blogging for another class or personal use that is
fine as well.  I find it useful to read posts on completely different
topics as it can help me better integrate this class into what is
going on elsewhere. However, if you do *not* want your non-ECE2524
related posts to show up on the class be sure to provide an RSS feed
that filters out your desired posts. If you need assistance with
setting up a filtered RSS feed for your particular blogging platform
please ask!

## Set up

Any blog service that offers an RSS/Atom feed will do. If you don't
have any preference then consider setting up an account at
[Blogs@VT](http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/).

## Get started, get into a routine

Getting in the habit of blogging is hard. It is very common to have
difficulty starting because you feel you "don't have anything to
write about". Or if you do that "it's not good enough" or you need
to "think more about it" first.  I've experienced all these excuses
and more, and so has everyone else I've talked to who has started
blogging. I will give a prompt for the first blog post, to help you
get started, but in general the assignment is very open ended, and
that's the point.  Write about how you feel about what's going on in
this class, or any other, write about a particular assignment, write
about world issues that you're interested in (and try to relate it
back to Unix/Linux/Open source... I can almost guarantee that there
is always a connection to be made between any two topics, no matter
how different they may seem). I am looking to see that you're making
connections between technical details and philosophy, or making
connections between Unix philosophy and other domains of knowledge.
