## File Descriptors, Processes and Pipes, oh my!

(Read by: Monday, February 24)

For a more in-depth understanding of how processes and files work at the system level:

Read [Chapter 0](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6/book-rev7.pdf#page=7) of "xv6: a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system"

The [xv6 operating system](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) was developed at MIT for their operating systems engineering class.  Chapter 0 of the documentation provides a really nice overview of what is going on at the system level when you run a command, redirect input/output, etc.
