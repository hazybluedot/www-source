title: Unix Interface Design Patterns
kind: reading

- Read [Unix Interface Design Patterns][interface_design_patterns] from [TAOUP]
- Follow the link in the last section to [Chapter 8][dsl_intro] and read the introduction to learn what is meant by "domain-specific minilanguage"

## Self Study

1. Notice that for the most part the discussion about design patterns
   doesn't mention specific programming languages. Why is that? How
   can this work toward your advantage when learning a new programming
   language or reading a program written in a language you are not
   familiar with?

2. While common in the Unix environment none of the design patterns
   discussed in this section are necessarily uniq to Unix or Unix-like
   systems. Do you recognize any of the patterns discussed in
   programms you have written for other classes or non-Unix
   environments?

3. One pattern that you are probably less likely to see in non-Unix
   environments are those listed under the 'Separate Engine and
   Interface' heaing. Why might these patterns be less likely to
   appear outside of the Unix community. Are the reasons
   technological, cultural or both?
