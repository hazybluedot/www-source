Read [Compactness and Orthogonality](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch04s02.html)

## Self Study

1. Is the
   [analytics API](https://computing.ece.vt.edu/~ece2524/assets/api/analytics/analytics_8h.html)
   I provided for the
   [Word Frequency Project](https://computing.ece.vt.edu/~ece2524/activities/word_count_part1/)
   compact? Is it orthogonal? If not, how could it be improved to be
   more compact and orthogonal?

2. The
   [split_words](/home/dmaczka/ece2524/lib/analytics/doc/html/analytics_8h.html#a1df986e1f2542185201288201e0364de)
   function takes a `FILE*` as a parameter. If instead it required a
   `char *` path name would it be more or less othogonal. Why?
