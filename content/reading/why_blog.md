title: 'Why Blog in an Intro to Unix Class?'
provides: { background: blog/motivation }

We will be blogging regularly during the semester (and hopefully
continuing afterwards as well!).  There are at least three good
reasons for this.

The Linux community is supported by its members. There have been
countless times I have been searching for a particular command, or
for a solution to a particular problem and come across the answer on
a blog post written by someone who had the same question I did.
Keeping an active blog is a way to participate in the community that
we will all rely on.

It also gives me (the instructor) an easy way to get more feedback
on how the course is going for everyone.  This can occur both
passively (in reading blog posts I get the sense that key concepts
haven't been explained well) or actively (you write about a specific
problem with the class, or an assignment).  I am always open to
constructive criticism, both regarding the content of the course,
and my own teaching style and philosophy, but it's very difficult
for me to address potential conflicts if I don't know they exist!

Last but certainly not least, an active blog is a component of your
professional digital identity.  Prospective employers or graduate
school admissions departments will almost certainly conduct an
internet search before selecting final candidates for
interviews. They *will* find your profiles up on various social
networking sites, embarrassing photos and all. You only have limited
control over that. But what you have much more control over is
whether or not that is the *only* piece of digital information they
have to evaluate you. 

Don't stress out about it. No one expects blog posts to be
professionally published articles.  They should be thoughtful, and
well written, but do not need to be ground breaking.  Posts along
the lines of "Here is my understanding of topic X so far, but I'm
still really confused about how it relates to Y and Z" are perfectly
acceptable.
