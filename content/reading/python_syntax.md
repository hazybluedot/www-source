title: "Learn Basic Python Syntax"
kind: reading
---

- For a good overview and comparison of Python to other languages,
  including [C] read the [Python section] in [Language Evaluations]
  from [TAOUP]
- Read and work through
  [Chapter 1. Your First Python Program](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/your-first-python-program.html)
  of [Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/)

- If you want additional practice learning syntax try the introductory
  Python courses at
  [codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python).  Keep in
  mind, these courses use Python 2 syntax and I will be sticking with
  Python 3 in class.

- The [Python documentation] serves as a good reference if you need to
  look up details for a particular module or function.
