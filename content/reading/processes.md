Read [Chapter 10](/assets/TLCL-13.07.pdf#page=132) of [TLCL](/assets/TLCL-13.07.pdf).  

Note, some of the examples include running graphical applications. To run remote graphical applications you can use [Xming](https://computing.ece.vt.edu/wiki/Xming) with PuTTY on windows, or use the `-X` option with `ssh` from a Unix based system:

    $ ssh -X ece2524.ece.vt.edu

Of course, if you're on a Unix based system you can just run all the
examples locally!
